In this lecture we

1. Discuss how to invert a Hilbert transform
2. Use it to solve ideal fluid flow around a plate

## Inverting the Hilbert transform

We now consider the problem of finding $u$ such that
$$
H_{[a,b]} u(x) = f(x)
$$
for $a < x < b$. Note that this is an additive jump problem: if we write $\phi(z) = \CC u(z)$ then we want to solve
$$
-\I (\phi_+(x) + \phi_-(x)) = f(x)
$$
where $\phi$ satisfies the conditions of Plemelj (Analyticity off $[a,b]$, weaker than pole singularities, decay at $\infty$).
If we can find such a $\phi$, Plemelj guarantees that $u$ is recovered via
$$
\phi_+(x) - \phi_-(x) = (\CC^+ - \CC^-)u(x) = u(x)
$$
To tackle this we are going to reduce it to a subtractive problem. Writing
$$
\kappa(z) = \sqrt{z-a} \sqrt{z-b}
$$
which satisfies
$$
\kappa_+(x) = \I \sqrt{b-x} \sqrt{x-a} = -  \kappa_-(x)
$$
Thus if we write
$$
\phi(z) = { \psi(z) \over \kappa(z) }
$$
for some new unknown $\psi$ we have that
$$
f(x) = -\I (\phi_+(x) + \phi_-(x)) = -\I \left({\psi_+(x) \over \kappa_+(x)} + {\psi_-(x) \over \kappa_-(x)}\right) =
-\I {\psi_+(x) - \psi_-(x) \over \kappa_+(x)}
$$
In other words, we want
$$
\psi_+(x) - \psi_-(x) =  \I f(x) \kappa_+(x) = -f(x)\sqrt{b-x}\sqrt{x-a}
$$
where we need $\psi$ to be bounded (the decay of $1/\kappa$ then ensures the decay of $\phi$).  Therefore by Plemelj
we have for $g(x) = f(x) \sqrt{b-x} \sqrt{x-a}$
$$
\psi(z) = -\CC g(z) - D
$$
and hence for
$$
\begin{align*}
u(x) &= \phi_+(x) - \phi_-(x) = {\psi_+(x)\over \kappa_+(x)} - {\psi_-(x)\over \kappa_-(x)} \\
&= -{\CC^+ g(x) + \CC^- g(x) + 2 D \over \kappa_+(x)}
= -{\I \HH g(x) + 2D \over \kappa_+(x)}\\
& = -{\HH_{[a,b]}[f \sqrt{b-\diamond}\sqrt{\diamond-a}](x) + 2 D \over \sqrt{b-x} \sqrt{x-a}}
\end{align*}
$$
where $\diamond$ denotes a dummy variable and $D$ is arbitrary.

In practice we determine $\HH g(x)$ by first computing its Cauchy transform.


_Example_ Let's try with $f(x) = x$ on $[-1,1]$. The first step is to compute the Cauchy transform of $g(x) = x \sqrt{1-x^2}$.
Using the usual technique this gives
$$
\CC g(z) = {z \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} - z^2 +1/2 \over 2 \I}
$$
where we use the Laurent series
$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} &= z \sqrt{1-1/z} \sqrt{1 + 1/z} \ccr
= z (1+1/(2z) - 1/(8 z^2) + O(z^{-3}))(1-1/(2z)  - 1/(8 z^2) + O(z^{-3})) \ccr
= z -{1 \over 2 z} + O(z^{-2})
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore
$$
\begin{align*}
\HH g(x) &= -\I (\CC^+ + \CC^-) g(x) = - {x \sqrt{x-1}_+ \sqrt{x+1} - x \sqrt{x-1}_- \sqrt{x+1} \over 2} + x^2 - 1/2 \ccr
= x^2 - 1/2
\end{align*}
$$
Giving us
$$
u(x) = -{x^2 - 1/2 + 2 D \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
Choosing $D = -1/4$ recovers the known solution $\sqrt{1-x^2}$.



## Ideal fluid flow

Understanding branch cuts and Cauchy transforms allows us to systematically solve equations involving the Laplace equation.
A classic example is ideal fluid flow. Consider the case of uniform flow with angle $\theta$ around an infinitesimally small
plate on $[-1,1]$. We can model this as
$$
\begin{align*}
v(x,y) &\sim y \cos \theta - x \sin \theta \qquad\hbox{as}\qquad x^2 + y^2 \to \infty  \\
v_{xx} + v_{yy} &= 0 \\
v(x,0) & = 0 \qqfor -1 < x <1
\end{align*}
$$
Using the techniques we developed in the last few lectures, we obtain a nice, simple, closed form expression for the solution as the
imaginary part of an analytic function:
```julia
using Plots, LinearAlgebra, ApproxFun, SingularIntegralEquations
Cw = (θ,z) -> -im*sin(θ)*(sqrt(z-1)sqrt(z+1) - z)
φ = (θ,z) -> exp(-im*θ)*z + Cw(θ,z)
u = (θ,x,y) -> imag(φ(θ, x + im*y))

xx = yy = range(-3; stop=3 , length=500)
contour(xx, yy, u.(1.3,xx',yy); nlevels = 100)
plot!(Segment(-1.,1.); color=:black, label="obstacle")
```
We divide this task into stages:

1. Rephrasing as a complex-analytical problem: $v(x,y)$ to $\phi(z)$
2. Reduction to inverting a Hilbert transform: $\phi(z)$ to $w(x)$
3. Calculating the inverse Hilbert transform: Finding $w(x)$
4. Calculating its Cauchy transform: $w(x)$ to $\phi(z)$



### Real and imaginary parts of analytic functions satisfy Laplace's equation

The real and imaginary parts of an analytic function satisfy Laplace's equation: that is  if
$\phi(z) = \phi(x + \I y) = u(x,y) + \I v(x,y)$ where $u$ and $v$ are the real/imaginary parts, then
$$
\begin{align*}
 u_{xx} + u_{yy}&= 0 \\
 v_{xx} + v_{yy} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
To see this, note that the complex-derivative of $\phi(z)$ can be written in terms of two different partial derivatives:
$$
\begin{align*}
    \phi'(z) &= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\phi(z+h) - \phi(z) \over h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {u(x+h,y)-u(x,y) + \I (v(x+h,y)-v(x,y)) \over h} = u_x + \I v_x \ccr
    \phi'(z) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\phi(z+\I h) - \phi(z) \over \I h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {u(x,y+h)-u(x,y) + \I (v(x,y+h)-v(x,y)) \over \I h} = - \I u_y + v_y
\end{align*}
$$
Taking a second derivative we get two equations:
$$
    \phi''(z) = u_{xx} + \I v_{xx} = -u_{yy} -\I v_{yy}
$$
which implies $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$ and $v_{xx} + v_{yy} = 0$.


### 2. Reduce PDE to the Hilbert transform of an unknown function

Therefore we can rewrite the ideal fluid flow equation as a problem of calculating $\phi(z) = u(x,y) + \I v(x,y)$
whose imaginary part is the solution to the ideal fluid flow PDE (we don't use the real part $u$). That is, we
want to find analytic $\phi(z)$ that satisfies
$$
\begin{align*}
    \phi(z) &\sim \E^{-\I \theta} z \qquad\hbox{as}\qquad z \to \infty \\
    \Im \phi(x) &= 0  \qquad\hbox{for}\qquad -1 < x < 1
\end{align*}
$$

Write
$$
\phi(z) = \E^{-\I \theta} z + c + \CC_{[-1,1]} w(z)
$$
for an as-of-yet unknown function $w$ and $c$ an unknown constant, we have (assuming $w$ is real) that
$$
0 = \Im \phi(x) = -x \sin \theta + \Im c + \Im \CC_{[-1,1]}^+ w(x) = -x \sin \theta + \Im c +{1 \over 2} \HH w(x)
$$
In this example, we can take $c = 0$. Therefore, we want to solve
$$
\HH w(x) =  2 x  \sin \theta
$$
for $w$.


### 3. Calculating the inverse Hilbert transform

We now plug the problem into the inverse Hilbert transform formula:
$$
    w(x) = {- 1\over \sqrt{1-x^2}} {\cal H}[f \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x)  + {D \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
where $f(x) = 2 x \sin \theta$. As we found before,

$$
{\cal C}[\diamond \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](z) = {z \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} - z^2 + 1/2 \over 2 \I }
$$
and therefore
$$
{\cal H}[\diamond \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) = -\I({\cal C}^+ + {\cal C}^-)[\diamond \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) = x^2 - {1 \over 2}
$$
Thus (relabeling $D$) we have
$$
w(x) = 2\sin \theta {D - x^2 \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$

_Demonstration_ Here we see that this gives us the right Hilbert transform:
```julia
D = randn()
θ = 0.1
x = Fun()
w = 2sin(θ) * (D-x^2)/sqrt(1-x^2)
-hilbert(w,0.2) , 2sin(θ)*0.2 # Minus in front of w to fix normalisation
```
$D$ is arbitrary, but from physical principles we know that we don't want the solution to blow up.
If $w$ blows up then so does its Cauchy transform. Therefore, we choose $D = 1$ so that
$$
w(x) = 2 \sin \theta \sqrt{1-x^2}
$$

### 4. Calculating its Cauchy transform

Now recall
$$
\CC\left[{\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}}\right](z) = {\sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} -z \over 2 \I}
$$
Therefore, $w(x) = 2 \sin \theta \sqrt{1-x^2}$,  implies
$$
\CC w(z) = - \I \sin \theta (\sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} -z)
$$
which means
$$
\phi(z) = \E^{-\I \theta} z - \I \sin \theta (\sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} -z).
$$


## Numerical example of two intervals

We note that for obstacles on the real line, represented by a contour $\Gamma$, the problem of ideal fluid
flow around $\Gamma$ is still reducible to solving the singular integral equation
$$
\HH_\Gamma f(x) = 2 x  \sin \theta
$$
Even when not solvable exactly, one can solve it numerically:
```julia
a = 0.3
θ = 1.3
Γ = Segment(-1,-a) ∪ Segment(a, 1)

x = Fun(Γ)
sp = PiecewiseSpace(JacobiWeight.(0.5,0.5,components(Γ))...)
H = Hilbert(sp)

o_1 = Fun(x -> -1 ≤ x ≤ -a ? 1 : 0, Γ )
o_2 = Fun(x -> a ≤ x ≤ 1 ? 1 : 0, Γ )

a, b, f = [o_1 o_2 H] \ [-2x*sin(θ)]

φ = (θ,z) -> exp(-im*θ)*z + cauchy(f, z)
u = (θ,x,y) -> imag(φ(θ, x + im*y))

xx = yy = range(-3.; stop=3., length=500)
contour(xx, yy, u.(θ, xx',yy); nlevels = 100)
plot!(Γ; color=:black, label="obstacle")
```
