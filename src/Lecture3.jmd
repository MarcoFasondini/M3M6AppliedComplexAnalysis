## Fourier and Laurent series

**Definition (Fourier series)** On $[-\pi, \pi)$,  _Fourier series_ is an expansion of the form
$$
    g(\theta) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty g_k \E^{i k \theta}
$$
where
$$
g_k = {1\over 2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi g(\theta) \E^{-i k \theta} d \theta
$$

**Definition (Laurent series)** In the complex plane, Laurent series around $z_0$ is an expansion of the form
$$
    f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f_k (z-z_0)^k
$$

**Lemma (Fourier series = Laurent series)** On a circle in the complex plane
$$
    C_r = \{z_0 + re^{i \theta} : -\pi \leq \theta < \pi \},
$$
Laurent series of $f(z)$ around $z_0$ converges for $z \in C_r$ if the Fourier series of $g(\theta) = f(z_0 + r e^{i \theta})$ converges, and the coefficients are given by

$$
f_k = {g_k \over r^k} = {1 \over 2 \pi i} \oint_{C_r} {f(\zeta) \over (\zeta - z_0)^{k+1}} d \zeta.
$$

**Proof**  This follows immediately from the change of variables $z = r \E^{\I \theta} + z_0$. ■

As we shall see in a future lecture, analytic properties of $f$ can be used to show decaying properties in $g$:


## Contour integrals and Laurent coefficients


In this module, we will _always_ think of Laurent series as living on a circle
$C_r(z_0) = \{z : |z-z_0| = r \}$.
That is,
$$
    f(z) \approx \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f_k (z-z_0)^k
$$

for $z \in C_r(z_0)$.

**Proposition (Residue on a circle)**
Suppose the Laurent series is absolutely summable on $C_r(z_0)$. Then
$$
\oint_{C_r(z_0)} f(z) dz = 2 \pi \I f_{-1}
$$
We refer to $f_{-1}$ as the residue over $C_r(z_0)$:
$$
\Res_{C_r(z_0)} f(z) := f_{-1} = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{C_r} f(z) \D z.
$$

*Example* For all $0 < r < \infty$,
$$
\oint_{C_r} {1 \over z} dz = 2 \pi \I
$$

When $f$ is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the circle, we can extend it to an annulus
(like Taylor series and disks):

**Proposition (Laurent series in an annulus)**
Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in an open annulus $A_{\rho R}(z_0) = \{z : \rho  < | z - z_0| < R\}$.
Then the Laurent series converges uniformly in  any closed annulus inside $A_{\rho R}$


_Proposition (Residue on a circle)_ holds true regardless of the radius, that is, the
definition of $f_{-1}$ only depends on the annulus of analyticity:
$$
\Res_{A_{\rho R}(z_0)} f(z) := f_{-1} = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{C_r} f(z) \D z.
$$
for any $\rho < r < R$.

## Isolated singularities

**Definition (isolated singularity)** $f$ has an  _isolated singularity at_ $z_0$ if it is holomorphic in an open annulus with inner radius 0:
$$
A_{0R}(z_0) = \{z : 0 < |z - z_0| < R \}.
$$


**Definition (Removable singularity)** $f$ has a _removable singularity at_ $z_0$ if it has an isolated singularity at $z_0$ and all negative terms in the Laurent series in $A_{0R}(z_0)$ are zero:
$$
f(z) = f_0 + f_1 (z-z_0) + f_2 (z-z_0)^2 + \cdots
$$
Equivalently, $f$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$ if it is bounded as $z \rightarrow z_0$.

An example would be a function like $f(z) = (\E^z - 1) / z$, which is analytic for $z \neq 0$ but is
not defined for $z = 0$. However, this singularity is artificial: we have from its Taylor series
that
$$
f(z) = (\E^{z} - 1)/z = (z + z^2 / 2! + \cdots)/z = 1 + z/2! + \cdots
$$
hence $f(z) \rightarrow 1$. We can therefore remove the singularity by taking $f_0$, the zeroth
Laurent coefficient:
$$
\tilde f(z) = \begin{cases}
    (\E^z - 1)/ z & z \neq 0 \\
    1 & z = 0
    \end{cases}
$$
This construction is general:

**Proposition (Removing a removable singularity)** If  $f$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$ and $f_0$
is the zeroth Laurent coefficient
$$
    f_0 := {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{C_r(z_0)} {f(z) \over z-z_0} \D z
$$
for $r$ sufficiently small,
then
$$
\tilde f(z) = \begin{cases} f_0 & z = z_0 \\
                                f(z) & 0 < |z-z_0| < R
                                \end{cases}
$$
is analytic in the disk $B_R(z_0) = \{ z : |z-z_0| < R \}$, with a convergent Taylor series. Hence the term `removable singularity'.




**Definition (simple pole)** $f$ has a  _simple pole at_ $z_0$ if it is holomorphic in
$$
  A_{0R}(z_0) = \{z : 0 < |z - z_0| < R \}
$$
with only one negative term in the Laurent series in $A_{0R}(z_0)$:
$$
  f(z) = {f_{-1} \over z - z_0}  + f_0 + f_1 (z - z_0) + \cdots
$$
where $f_{-1} \neq 0$.

**Definition (higher order pole)** $f$ has a  _pole of order $N$ at_ ${z_0}$ if it is holomorphic in
$$
 A_{0R}(z_0) = \{z : 0 < |z - z_0| < R \}
$$
with only $N$ negative coefficients in the Laurent series:
$$
 f(z) = {f_{-N} \over (z - z_0)^N}  + {f_{1-N} \over (z - z_0)^{N-1}} +  \cdots + {f_{-1} \over z-z_0} + f_0 + f_1 (z-z_0) + \cdots
$$
where $f_{-N} \neq 0$.



**Definition (essential singularity)** $f$ has an _essential singularity at_ $z_0$ if it is holomorphic in $A_{0R}(z_0)$ and has an infinite number of negative Laurent coefficients.

An essential singularity is complicated but isolated, hence
we can still calculate the integrals using Residue calculus.


### Residue at a point

**Definition (Residue at a point)** Suppose $f$ has an isolated singularity at $z_0$, and is analytic in the annulus $A_{0R}(z_0)$ for some $R > 0$. Then we define the _residue at_ $z_0$ as
$$
{\underset{z = z_0}{\rm Res}}\, f(z) = {\underset{A_{0R}}{\rm Res}}\, f(z) = f_{-1}
$$
where $f_{-1}$ is the first negative coefficient of the Laurent series in $A_{0R}(z_0)$, that is, integrating over $C_r$ for any $0 < r < R$.

**Proposition (Residue of ratio of analytic functions with simple pole)** Suppose
$$
f(z) = {A(z) \over B(z)}
$$
and $A$, $B$ are analytic/holomorphic in a disk of radius $R$ around $z_0$ and that $B$ has only a single zero at $z_0$:
$$
\begin{align*}
A(z) = A_0 + A_1(z-z_0) + \cdots \cr
B(z) = B_1(z-z_0) + \cdots
\end{align*}
$$
Then ${\underset{z = z_0}{\rm Res}}\, f(z) = {A_0 \over B_1}$

**Exercise (Residue of ratio of analytic functions with higher order  poles)** What is the residue at $z_0$ if $B$ has a higher order zero: $B(z) = B_N (z-z_0)^N + \cdots$?

## Contour integrals on domains with multiple holes


Consider the following example:

$$
    {\sqrt{z-1}\sqrt{z+1} \over z^2 + 4}
$$

We still have the contour integral over a circle, and so _Proposition (Residue on a circle)_ still holds true for $r > 2$. But we can also deform the contour into three contours:

```julia
using ApproxFun, Plots, ComplexPhasePortrait
f = z -> sqrt(z-1)sqrt(z+1)/(z^2+4)

Γ = Circle(1.1) ∪ Circle(2.0im,0.1) ∪ Circle(-2.0im,0.1)
phaseplot(-2..2, -3..3, f)
plot!(Γ; color=:black, label="contour, Γ", arrow=true, linewidth=1.5)
```

```julia
sum(Fun(f, Circle(2.1))), sum(Fun(f, Γ))
```

Thus we can sum over three residues.

### Residue theorem

**Theorem (Cauchy's Residue Theorem)** Let $f$ be holomorphic inside and on a simple closed, positively oriented contour $\gamma$ except at isolated points $z_1, \ldots, z_r$ inside $\gamma$. Then

$$
\oint_\gamma f(z) dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{j=1}^r {\underset{z = z_j}{\rm Res}}\, f(z)
$$

### Calculating integrals

We can use the Residue theorem to calculate "hard" integrals.
First, two trivial examples: consider
$$
f(z) = {\E^z \over z (z+2)}
$$
This has two simple poles, one at $z=0$ and one at $z = -2$, as seen clearly from the
phase portrait:
```julia
f = z -> exp(z)/(z*(z+2))
phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, f)
```
Consider integrating over $C_3$, a circle of radius 3 centred at the origin.
The residues are
$$
\begin{align*}
\Res_{z=0} f(z) = \Res_{z=0}  {1 \over z} {\E^z \over z+2} = {1 \over 2} \\
\Res_{z=-2} f(z) = \Res_{z=-2}  {1 \over z+2} {\E^z \over z} = -{\E^{-2} \over 2}
\end{align*}
$$
Thus the integral must be equal to $2 \pi \I (1/2 - \E^{-2} /2)$.
This matches a numerical approximation of the integral
```julia
sum(Fun(f, Circle(3.0))), 2π*im*(1/2 - exp(-2)/2)
```
A more complicated example is
$$
f(z) = {\E^z \over z^2 (z+2)}
$$
which has a double pole at $z = 0$. We find the residue by expanding in Taylor series:
$$
 {1 \over z^2} {\E^z \over z +2} = {1 \over  2 z^2} (1 + z + O(z^2)) (1 - z/2 + O(z^2)) =
        {1 \over 2 z^2} + {1 \over 4 z} + O(1)
$$
That is,
$$
\Res_{z=0} f(z) = {1 \over 4} \qqand \Res_{z=-2} f(z) = {\E^{-2} \over 4}
$$
Again, residue calculus matches the numerical computation:
```julia
sum(Fun(z -> exp(z)/(z^2*(z+2)), Circle(3.0))), 2*pi*im * (1/4 + exp(-2)/4)
```
