# Lecture 12: Cauchy transforms and Plemelj's theorem

This lecture concerns the properties of the Cauchy transform:

**Definition (Cauchy transform)**
For a contour $\gamma$ and $f : \gamma \rightarrow \C$ define the _Cauchy transform_ as
$$
\CC_\gamma f(z) := {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_\gamma {f(\zeta) \over \zeta - z} \D \zeta
$$
Unlike in Cauchy's integral formula, $f$ need not be analytic and $\gamma$ need not be closed.

We focus on the case of an interval $[a,b]$:
$$
\CC_{[a,b]} f(z) := {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_a^b {f(x) \over x - z} \dx
$$
Here is a phase portrait of the Cauchy transform of a simple function:
```julia
using ApproxFun, SingularIntegralEquations, ComplexPhasePortrait, Plots
x = Fun(-1 .. 1)
f = exp(x)*sqrt(1-x^2)
phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, z -> cauchy(f,z))
```
What's evident here is that it has a jump on the contour.
It turns out that the Cauchy transform has a very simple subtractive jump. Here we denote
$$
\begin{align*}
    \CC_{[a,b]}^+ f(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \CC_{[a,b]} f( x+ \I \epsilon)\\
        \CC_{[a,b]}^- f(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \CC_{[a,b]} f( x- \I \epsilon)
        \end{align*}
$$
that is the limit from above and below. For more complicated contours these would denote the limit from the left/right or
in the case of a simple closed contour, interior/exterior.


**Theorem (Plemelj on the interval I)**
Suppose $(b-x)^\alpha (x-a)^\beta f(x)$ is differentiable  on $[a,b]$, for $\alpha, \beta < 1$.
Then the Cauchy transform has the following properties:
1. _Analyticity_: $\CC_{[a,b]} f(z)$ is analytic in $\bar \C \backslash [a,b]$
2. _Decay_: $\CC_{[a,b]} f(\infty) = 0$
3. _Jump_: It has the subtractive jump:
$$
\CC_{[a,b]}^+ f(x) - \CC_{[a,b]}^- f(x) = f(x) \qqfor a < x < b
$$
4. _Regularity_: $\CC_{[a,b]} f(z)$ has weaker than pole singularities at $a$ and $b$

**Sketch of Proof**
We show the proof for $[-1,1]$.

1. From the dominated convergence theorem, we know that $\CC f(z)$ is complex-differentiable off $[-1,1]$:
$$
{\D \over \D z} {\cal C} f(z) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I}\int_{-1}^1  {\D \over \D z} {f(x) \over x - z} \dx = {1 \over 2 \pi \I}\int_{-1}^1   {f(x) \over (x - z)^2} \dx
$$
We know it is analytic at $\infty$ because
$$
{\cal C} f(z^{-1}) = z {1 \over 2 \pi \I}\int_{-1}^1   {f(x) \over z x - 1} \dx
$$
is differentiable at zero.
2. ${\cal C} f(\infty) = 0$ follows from uniform convergence of $1 \over z - x$ to zero as $z \rightarrow \infty$.
3.  For the constant function, which is analytic, this follows by considering a contour $\gamma_x^+$ perturbed above $x$ and $\gamma_x^-$ perturbed below $x$, see the plot below:
```julia
x = 0.4
r = 0.1
tt = range(π,0.; length=100)
plot([-1.; x .+ r*cos.(tt);1.0], [0.; r*sin.(tt); 0.0];ylims=(-0.5,0.5),label="γₓ+", ratio=1.0)
plot!([-1.; x .+ r*cos.(tt);1.0], [0.; -r*sin.(tt); 0.0];ylims=(-0.5,0.5),label="γₓ-")
```
Therefore, by the Cauchy integral formula we have
$$
\CC^+ 1 (x) - \CC^- 1 (x) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I}\int_{\gamma_x^-} {1 \over x - z} \dx - {1 \over 2 \pi \I}\int_{\gamma_x^+} {1 \over x - z} \dx = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint {1 \over x -z } \dx = 1.
$$
For other functions, we consider, for $z = x + \I \epsilon$,
$$
    {\cal C} f(z) =   {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{-1}^1 {f(t) - f(x) \over t - z} \dt + f(x) \CC 1(z)
$$
For $\epsilon = 0$, the first integral exists because the singularity at $t = x$ is removable:
$$
\lim_{t \rightarrow x} {f(t) - f(x) \over t - x} = f'(x)
$$
We leave it as an exercise (or see [Trogdon & Olver 2015, _Riemann-Hilbert Problems, Their Numerical Solution, and the Computation of Nonlinear Special Functions_, Lemma 2.7]) to show that $\int_{-1}^1 {f(t) - f(x) \over t - z} \dt$ converges to $\int_{-1}^1 {f(t) - f(x) \over t - x} \dt$ as $z \rightarrow x$. It follows that
$$
{\cal C}^\pm f(x) =   {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{-1}^1 {f(t) - f(x) \over t - x} \dt + f(x) \CC^\pm 1(x)
$$
and in particular
$$
{\cal C}^+ f(x) - {\cal C}^- f(x)  =  f(x) (\CC^+ 1(x) - \CC^- 1(x)) = f(x)
$$
4. We show that it has a weaker than pole singularity at $+1$, with $-1$ following by the same argument. First note that $f$ is absolutely integrable.
If we assume we approach $1$ at an angle of $-\pi + \delta \leq \theta \leq \pi - \delta$, the uniform convergence of $(z - 1) \CC f(z)$ to zero follows from observing that ${z-1 \over z - t}$ can be made arbitrarily small in a larger and larger interval. This is easiest to see for real $x > 1$, where for
 $1 \leq x \leq 1 + \epsilon^2$ we have
$$
\left|{x -1 \over x-t }\right| \leq \epsilon
$$
for all $t \leq 1 + \epsilon^2 - \epsilon$, or more generously, $t \leq 1 - \epsilon$.
Here is a plot of ${x - 1 \over x- t}$ showing that it is small on an increasing portion of the interval as $x \rightarrow 1$ from the right:
```julia
x = 1 + 0.01
tt = range(-1.,1.; length=1000)
plot(tt, abs.((x - 1) ./ (x .- tt)); legend=false)
```

Therefore,
$$
| (x-1) {\cal C} f(x) | \leq {1 \over 2 \pi}\int_{-1}^{1-\epsilon} |f(t) | \left|{x -1 \over x-t }\right| \dt + \int_{1-\epsilon}^1 |f(t) | \dt \leq
\epsilon \int_{-1}^1 |f(t)| \dt + \int_{1-\epsilon}^1 |f(t) | \dt
$$
Both terms tends to zero as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, hence so does $| (x-1) {\cal C} f(x) |$.  To extend this to the interval itself (that is, $\delta = 0$), we  use the stronger requirement that $(1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta f(x)$ is differentiable. For $\alpha = \beta = 0$, this follows from the expression in condition (3) and the fact that (found via direct integration)
$$
    \CC 1(z) =  {\log(z-1) - \log(z+1) \over 2 \pi \I}
$$
has only logarithmic singularities, and $f(x)$ is bounded.

■
_Remark:_ The singularities of  $\CC_{[a,b]} f(z)$ at $z = a, b$ are analysed in detail in [Lemma 7.2.2, Ablowitz & Fokas, _Complex Variables: Introduction and Applications_](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/). Roughly speaking, if $f$ is smooth on $[a, b]$, then  $\CC_{[a,b]} f(z)$ will have logarithmic singularities at $z = a, b$ (e.g., $\CC 1(z)$). If $f$ has an algebraic branch point at $a$ or $b$ of order $\alpha$, then so has $\CC_{[a,b]} f(z)$. For example, if $f(x) = g(x)/\sqrt{1 -x^2}$ and $g$ is smooth on $[-1, 1]$, then $f$ has branch points of order $-1/2$ at $\pm 1$ and
$$
\CC_{[a,b]} f(z) = O\left( (1-z)^{-1/2}  \right),\qquad z \to 1,
$$
and
$$
\CC_{[a,b]} f(z) = O\left( (1+z)^{-1/2}  \right),\qquad z \to -1.
$$

We can use the previous results, combined
with Liouville's theorem, to show that the function satisfying (1)-(4) is in fact unique:

**Theorem (Liouville)** If $f$ is entire and  bounded in ${\mathbb C}$, then $f$ must be constant.



**Theorem (Plemelj on the interval II)** Suppose $\phi(z)$ satisfies the following properties:
1. _Analyticity_: $\phi(z)$ is analytic in $\bar \C \backslash [a,b]$
2. _Decay_: $\phi(\infty) = 0$
3. _Jump_: It has the subtractive jump:
$$
\phi^+(x) - \phi^-(x) = f(x) \qqfor a < x < b
$$
where $(b-x)^\alpha (x-a)^\beta f(x)$ is differentiable in $[a,b]$ for $\alpha,\beta < 1$.
4. _Regularity_: $\phi(z)$ has weaker than pole singularities at $a$ and $b$



Then $\phi(z) = {\cal C}_{[a,b]} f(z)$.

**Sketch of Proof**
Consider
$$
A(z) = \phi(z) - {\cal C}_{[a,b]} f(z)
$$
This is continuous (hence analytic) on $(a,b)$ as
$$
A^+(x) - A^-(x) = \phi^+(x) -\phi^-(x) - {\cal C}_{[a,b]}^+ f(x) + {\cal C}_{[a,b]}^- f(x)  =f(x) - f(x) = 0
$$
Also, $A$ has weaker than pole singularities at $a$ and $b$, hence is analytic there as well: it's entire.
Only entire functions that are bounded are constant, since it vanishes at $\infty$ the constant must be zero.

_Example 1_ We can use this theorem to prove the following relationships  (using $\diamond$ for the dummy variable):

$$
{1 \over \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1}} = -2 \I {\cal C}\left[{1 \over \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}}\right](z) =
-{1 \over \pi}\int_{-1}^1 {\dx \over \sqrt{1-x^2} (x-z)}
$$
(1) follows because the jumps cancel. (2 and 4) are immediate. (3) follows from a simple calculation.

_Example 2_ Now consider a problem of reducing
$$
\phi(z) = \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1}
$$
to its behaviour near its singularities. It has two singularities: it blows up at $\infty$ and has a branch cut on $[-1,1]$


We can subtract out the singularity at infinity first to determine
$$
\phi(z) = z  + 2 \I {\cal C}[\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](z)
$$
Note this works because, as $z \rightarrow \infty$, we have
$$
\phi(z) = z (\sqrt{1-{1/z}}\sqrt{1 + {1/z}}) = z (1 + O({1/z}))(1+O(1/z)) = z + O(1/z)
$$
hence $\phi(z) - z$ vanishes at $\infty$. This is an example of summing over the behaviour at each singularity to
recover the function (in this case, $\phi$ has a singularity along the cut $[-1,1]$ and polynomial growth at $\infty$).

Because $\phi(z)-z$ decays, we can now deploy Plemelj II to determine:
$$
\phi(z) -z = \CC[\phi_+-\phi_-](z)
$$
where
$$
\phi_+(x) - \phi_-(x) = 2\I \sqrt{1-x^2}
$$

_Example 3_ Finally, we have the following (also verifiable using indefinite integration):

$$
{\log(z-1) - \log(z+1) \over 2 \pi \I} =  {\cal C}[1](z) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{-1}^1 {\dx \over x -z}
$$


__Demonstration__ From the phase plot we see it has a branch cut on $[-1,1]$:
```julia
κ = z -> 1/(sqrt(z-1)sqrt(z+1))
phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, κ)
```
On the branch there is the expected jump:
```julia
x = 0.1
κ(x + 0.0im) - κ(x - 0.0im) , -2im/sqrt(1-x^2)
```
For $x < -1$ the branch cut is removable: we have continuity and therefore analyticity:
```julia
x = -2.3
κ(x + 0.0im) - κ(x - 0.0im)
```
3\. $\mu(z) = {\log(z -1) - \log(z+1) \over 2 \pi \I}$ is the unique function analytic in $\C \backslash [-1,1]$ with weaker than pole singularities at $\pm 1$ satisfying $\mu(\infty) = 0$ and
$$
\mu_+(x) - \mu_-(x) = 1 \qqfor -1 < x < 1.
$$

_Demonstration_ Here we see from the phase plot of $\mu$ that it has a branch cut on $[-1,1]$:
```julia
μ = z -> (log(z-1) - log(z+1))/(2π*im)
phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, μ)
```
For $-1 < x < 1$ we have the jump $1$:
```julia
x = 0.3
μ(x + 0.0im) - μ(x - 0.0im)
```
For $x < -1$ we see that the branch cuts cancel and we have continuity:
```julia
x = -4.3
μ(x + 0.0im) - μ(x - 0.0im)
```

**Remark** As an aside, these integrals are computationally difficult because of the singularity in the integrand,
hence standard integration methods become slow as $z$ approaches the interval.
There are other specialised routines (as implemented in `cauchy(f,z)`) that are much more efficient:
```julia
using BenchmarkTools
z = 0.1 +0.0001im
x = Fun()
f = exp(x)
# μs is micro seconds (1E-6 seconds) while ms is milliseconds (1E-3 seconds)
@btime cauchy(f, z ) # specialised routine
@btime sum(f/(x-z))/(2π*im) # standard quadrature
```
We can evaluate the limit from above and below using the specialised routine,
where standard quadrature breaks down. Here we see numerically that we recover $f$ from taking the difference:
```julia
cauchy(f, 0.1+0.0im)-cauchy(f, 0.1-0.0im) , f(0.1)
```
