## Solving logarithmic singular integral equations

Consider the problem of calculating $u(x)$ such that
$$
{1 \over \pi} \int_a^b u(t) \log | x-t| \dt = f(x) \qqfor a < x < b
$$


To tackle this problem, recall that $L u(z) = \Re M u(z)$ for
$$
M u(z) = {1 \over \pi} \int_a^b \log(z-t) u(t) \D t =  -2 \I \int_c^z \CC u(\zeta) \D \zeta + M u(c)
$$
where $c$ is arbitrary, in fact we can choose it to be $b$. Then we have
$$
L u(x) =  \Re M^+ u(x) = 2\Im \int_b^x \CC^+ u(t) \D t =  \int_b^x H u(t) \D t
$$
where
$$
\HH u(x) = {1 \over \pi} \dashint_a^b {u(t) \over t -x } \D t
$$
is the Hilbert transform. In other words, we have
$$
{\D \over \dx} L u(x) = \HH u(x).
$$
Differentiating both sides of the equation for $u$ therefore gives
$$
\HH u(x) = f'(x).
$$
recall, we can express the solution as
$$
    u = {-\HH[\sqrt{b-\diamond}\sqrt{\diamond-a} f'] + D \over \sqrt{b-x}\sqrt{x-a}}
$$
Here the constant $D$ is not arbitrary: recall that
$$
L[1/\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) = - \log 2
$$
hence varying $D$ will vary $u$ by a constant.
To choose $D$,  we use the fact that
$$
f(c) = {1 \over \pi} \int_a^b u(t) \log |t-c| \dt
$$
for any choice of the point  $c$.

__Demonstration__

Let's do a numerical example:
```julia
using ApproxFun, SingularIntegralEquations, Plots
H(f) = -hilbert(f) # fix normalisation
H(f,x) = -hilbert(f,x)


x = Fun()
f = exp(x)
D = randn()

u₁ = -H(sqrt(1-x^2)*f')/sqrt(1-x^2)

u = u₁ + D/sqrt(1-x^2)

@show H(u, 0.1) - f'(0.1)
@show logkernel(u,0.1) - f(0.1)  # didn't work
@show logkernel(u,0.2) - f(0.2);  # but we are only off by a constant
```
We thus need to choose the constant
```julia
# choose C so that
# logkernel(u₁, 0) + C*logkernel(1/sqrt(1-x^2), 0) == f(0)
C = (f(0) - logkernel(u₁, 0))/logkernel(1/sqrt(1-x^2), 0)
u = u₁ + C/sqrt(1-x^2)

@show H(u, 0.1) - f'(0.1)
@show logkernel(u,0.1) - f(0.1)  # Works!
@show logkernel(u,0.2) - f(0.2);  # And at all x!
```


__Example 1__ We now do an example which can be solved by hand.
Find $u(x)$ so that:
$$
L u(x) = x
$$
for $-1 < x < 1$. Differentiating his becomes
$$
\HH u(x) = 1
$$
which we solve via
$$
u(x) = {- \HH[\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) + D \over \sqrt{1-x^2}} = {D-x \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
Note that
$$
L u(0) = 0
$$
A symmetry argument shows that
$$
L [\diamond/\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](0) = {1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 {t \over \sqrt{1-t^2}} \log|t| \D t = 0
$$
which implies that $D = 0$ and we have
$$
u(x) = {-x \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
We can confirm this:
```julia
x = Fun()
logkernel(-x/sqrt(1-x^2), 0.1) # approximately 0.1
```



__Example 2__
Find $u(x)$ so that:
$$
{1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 u(t) \log | x-t| \dt = 1.
$$
Differentiating, we know that
$$
\int_{-1}^1 {u(t) \over x-t} \dt = 0
$$
hence $u(x)$ must be of the form ${D / \sqrt{1-x^2}}$.  Since we know
$$
L[{1 /\sqrt{1-\diamond^2}}](x) = - \log 2
$$
we have $D = -1/\log 2$. Let's check:
```julia
x = Fun()
u = -1/(log(2)*sqrt(1-x^2))
logkernel(u, 0.1) # approximately 0.1
```
Physically, this solution gives us the potential field
$$
L u(z)
$$
corresponding to holding a metal plate at constant potential:
```julia
v = z -> logkernel(u, z)

xx = yy = -2:0.01:2
V = v.(xx' .+ im*yy)

surface(xx, yy, V)
```

## Application: Potential arising from a point charge and a single plate

Now imagine we put a point source at $x = 2$, and a metal plate on $[-1,1]$.
We know the potential on the plate must be constant, but we don't know what constant.
This is equivalent to the following problem (see e.g. [\[Chapman, Hewett & Trefethen 2015\]](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/chapman_hewett_trefethen.pdf)):
$$
\begin{align*}
v_{xx} + v_{yy} = 0 &\qqfor \hbox{$z$ off $[-1,1]$ and $2$}  \\
v(z) \sim \log |z - 2| + O(1) &\qqfor z \rightarrow 2 \\
v(z) \sim \log|z| + o(1) &\qqfor z \rightarrow \infty \\
v(x) = \kappa &\qqfor -1 < x < 1
\end{align*}
$$
where $\kappa$ is an unknown constant.  We write the solution as
$$
v(z) = {1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 u(t) \log|t-z| \dt + \log|z-2|
$$
for a to-be-determined $u$. On $-1 < x < 1$ this satisfies
$$
 {1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 u(t) \log|t-x| \dt  = \kappa - \log(2-x)
$$

We can solve this equation explicitly. By differentiating we see that $u$ satisfies the following:
$$
\HH u(x) = f'(x) = {1 \over 2-x}
$$
We now use the inverse Hilbert formula to determine:
$$
u(x) = {1\over\sqrt{1-x^2}} \HH [{1 \over \diamond-2} \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) + {D \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
Using the usual procedure of taking an obvious ansatz and subtracting off the singularities at poles and $\infty$ we find that:
$$
\CC[{\sqrt{1-\diamond^2} \over x -2}](z) =
\underbrace{\sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} \over 2 \I (z-2)}_{\hbox{ansatz}} - \underbrace{\sqrt 3\over 2 \I (z-2)}_{\hbox{remove pole near $z=2$}} - \underbrace{{1 \over 2 \I}}_{\hbox{remove constant at $\infty$}}
$$
This implies that
$$
\HH[{1 \over\diamond-2} \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) = -\I(C^+ + C^-)[{1 \over\diamond-2} \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}](x) = {\sqrt 3 \over x -2} + 1
$$
in other words,
$$
u = {\sqrt{3} \over (x - 2) \sqrt{1-x^2}} + {D \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
We still need to determine $D$. This is chosen so that we tend to $\log |z|$ near $\infty$. In particular, we know that
$$
{1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 \log|z-x| u(x) \dx \sim  {\int_{-1}^1 u(x) \dx \over \pi}  \log |z|
$$
so we need to choose $D$ so that $\int_{-1}^1 u(x) \dx = 0$ and only the $\log|z-2|$ singularity appears near $\infty$. We first note that
$$
\begin{align*}
C[{1 \over (\diamond - 2) \sqrt{1-\diamond^2}}](z) &= \underbrace{{\I \over 2 \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1} (z-2)}}_{\hbox{ansatz}} - \underbrace{{\I \over  2\sqrt{3} (z-2)}}_{\hbox{remove pole}} \\
& = -{\I \over 2 \sqrt{3} z} + O(z^{-2})
\end{align*}
$$
near $\infty$. Since
$$
Cw(z)  ={ \int_{-1}^1 w(x) \dx \over -2\pi \I z} + O(z^{-2})
$$
we can  infer the integral from the Cauchy transform and find that
$$
\int_{-1}^1 {1 \over (x - 2) \sqrt{1-x^2}} \dx = -{ \pi \over \sqrt{3}}
$$
On the other hand,
$$
\int_{-1}^1 {\dx \over \sqrt{1-x^2}} = \pi
$$
Thus we require $D = 1$ and have the solution:
$$
u(x) = {\sqrt{3} \over (x - 2) \sqrt{1-x^2}} + {1 \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$


_Demonstration_
```julia
x = Fun()
u = sqrt(3)/((x-2)*sqrt(1-x^2)) + 1/sqrt(1-x^2)
v = z -> logkernel(u, z) + log(abs(z-2))

xx =  yy = -4:0.011:4
V = v.(xx' .+ im*yy)

contour(xx, yy, V;ratio=1.0)
plot!(domain(x); color=:black, legend=false)
```
We can compute $\kappa$ numerically:
```julia
v(0.2)
```
