# Lecture 11: Representing analytic functions by their behaviour near singularities

A _key_ theme in complex analysis is representing functions by their behaviour near singularities.
A simple example of this is a partial fraction expansion: a rational function $p(z)/q(z)$ can be
expressed as a sum of its behaviour near poles and infinity. This is more complicated, but doable
in a systematic manner for functions with branch cuts.  In this lecture we:

1. Derive partial fraction expansions using Cauchy's integral formula
2. Recover functions such as $\sqrt{z-1}\sqrt{z+1}$ from their behaviour on the branch cut

## Partial fraction expansion

**Theorem (Cauchy's integral representation around holes)** Let $D \subset {\mathbb C}$ be a domain with $g$ holes (i.e., genus $g$).
Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in and on the boundary of $D$.  Given $g$ simple closed negatively oriented contours
 surrounding the holes $\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_g$ and a simple closed positively oriented contour $\gamma_\infty$ surrounding
 the outer boundary of $D$, we have for $z \in D$,
$$
f(z) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \br[\sum_{k=1}^{g} \oint_{\gamma_k} + \oint_{\gamma_\infty}] {f(\zeta) \over \zeta - z} \D \zeta
$$

Here is an example. Consider
$$
f(z) = (\E^{1/z} + \E^z) / (z (z+2))
$$
which has an essential singularity at 0 and $\infty$ and a simple pole at $-2$.
We can recover $f$ from contours around each singularity:
```julia
using ApproxFun, ComplexPhasePortrait, Plots
f = z -> (exp(1/z) + exp(z))/(z*(z+2))
Γ = Circle(0.0, 4.0) ∪ Circle(0.0,0.5,false) ∪ Circle(-2.0,0.1,false)
phaseplot(-5..5, -5..5, f)
plot!(Γ; color=:black, label="contour", arrow=true, linewidth=1.5)
```
Cauchy's integral formula is still valid:
```julia
ζ = Fun(Γ)
z = 2.0+1.0im
sum(f.(ζ)/(ζ - z))/(2π*im), f(z)
```

Now we specialise to the case where we have a rational function
$$
r(z) = {p(z) \over q(z)}
$$
where $p,q$ are both polynomials. This is analytic everywhere apart from the roots
of $q$, which we enumerate $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_g$.   If we integrate over negatively oriented circles
around each root:
```julia
n = 7
m = 5
p = Fun(Taylor(), randn(n))
q = Fun(Taylor(), randn(m))
λ = complexroots(q)

Γ = Circle(0.0, 5.0)
for λ in λ
    global Γ
    Γ = Γ ∪ Circle(λ, 0.1, false)
end
r = z -> extrapolate(p,z)/extrapolate(q,z)

phaseplot(-5..5, -5..5, r)
plot!(Γ; color=:black, label="contour")
```
we recover the function:
```julia
ζ = Fun(Γ)
z = 2.0+2.0im
sum(r.(ζ)/(ζ - z))/(2π*im) , r(z)
```
But now we can use the residue theorem to simplify the integrals!

Near the $j$th root we have the Laurent series
$$
r(z) = r_{-N_j}^j (z-\lambda_j)^{-N_j}  + \cdots + r_{-1}^j (z-\lambda_j)^{-1} + r_0^j + r_1^j (z-\lambda_j) + \cdots
$$
where $N_j$ is the order of the zero of $q(z)$ at $\lambda_j$.

Then it follows that
$$
{1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{\gamma_j} {r(\zeta) \over z - \zeta} \D\zeta =
r_{-N_j}^j (z-\lambda_j)^{-N}  + \cdots + r_{-1}^j (z-\lambda_j)^{-1}
$$
for $z$ outside the contour $\gamma_j$.

Similarly, for the contour around infinity $\gamma_\infty$, if we have the Laurent series
$$
r(z) = \cdots + r_{-1}^\infty z^{-1} + r_0^\infty  + r_1^\infty z + \dots + r_{N_0}^\infty z^{N_0}
$$
where $N_\infty$ is the degree of $p(z)$ minus the degree of $q(z)$.
Then we have
$$
{1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{\gamma_\infty} {r(\zeta) \over \zeta - z} \D\zeta =
r_0^\infty + r_1^\infty z + \cdots +  r_{N_{\infty}}^\infty z^{N_{\infty}}.
$$

Thus we have the expansion summing over the behaviour near each singularity that holds for all $z$:
$$
r(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{N_\infty} r_k^\infty z^k  +  \sum_{j=1}^d \sum_{k = -N_j}^{-1} r_k^j (z - \lambda_j)^k
$$
*Example* When we only have simple poles and no polynomial growth at $\infty$, this has a simple form in terms of residues:
$$
r(z) = r(\infty)  +  \sum_{j=1}^d    (z - \lambda_j)^{-1} \underset{z = \lambda_j}{\rm Res}\, r(z)
$$
Here we demonstrate it on a random polynomial:
```julia
n = 5
m = 5
p = Fun(Taylor(), randn(n))
q = Fun(Taylor(), randn(m))
λ = complexroots(q)

r = z -> extrapolate(p,z)/extrapolate(q,z)

phaseplot(-7..7, -7..7, r)
```
This constructs `r_2` as the partial fraction expansion of `r`:
```julia
res = extrapolate.(p,λ)./extrapolate.(q',λ)
r∞ = p.coefficients[n]/q.coefficients[m]

r_2 = z -> r∞ + sum(res.*(z .- λ).^(-1))

z = 0.1+0.2im
r(z) - r_2(z) # we match to high accuracy
```

## Recovering analytic functions

We now consider the above approach for 2 examples with branch cuts.

__Example 1__

Consider $\phi(z) = \log(z-1) - \log(z+1)$. For $x < -1$ the branch cuts cancel
and we have
$$
\phi_+(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^{+}} \phi(x + \I \epsilon) = \log_+(x-1) - \log_+(x+1) =
\log|x-1| + \I \pi - \log|x+1| - \I \pi = \log(1-x) - \log(-1-x).
$$
Similarly
$$
\phi_-(x) =  \log(1-x) - \log(-1-x) = \phi_+(x)
$$
i.e., we are continuous on the branch cut (with $\phi(x) := \phi_+(x)$)
and therefore analytic. Thus $\phi(z)$ is analytic off $[-1,1]$
which can be seen clearly from a phase portrait. Using the corollary above
we can recover $f$ from integrating over two contours: $\gamma_\infty$ surrounding $\infty$
and $\gamma_0$ surrounding the branch cut, with $z$ in-between:
```julia
φ = z -> log(z-1) - log(z+1)
phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, φ)
θ = range(0,2π; length=200)
plot!(2.5cos.(θ), 2.5sin.(θ); color=:black, label="γ∞", arrow=true)
plot!(1.2cos.(θ), 0.2sin.(-θ); color=:blue, label="γ₀", arrow=true)
scatter!([0.1],[0.5]; label="z")
```
That is, we have
$$
\phi(z) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \br[\oint_{\gamma_0} + \oint_{\gamma_\infty}] {\phi(\zeta) \over \zeta -z} \D \zeta
$$
<!--Note that $\phi(z)$ is analytic in a neighbourhood of $\infty$ and has weaker-than-pole growth:
it can only grow at worse like $\log z$. Thus it must be analytic at $\infty$. To determine the
constant we use a simple Taylor series argument, evaluating on the real axis to simplify rules of
logarithms: as $x \rightarrow \infty$ we have
$$
\phi(x) = \log(x-1) - \log(x+1) = \log x + \log(1-1/x) - \log x - \log(1 +1/x) \rightarrow 0,
$$
that is $\phi(\infty) = 0$, and in fact $\phi(z) = O(z^{-1})$ as $\phi(z^{-1})$ is analytic at
zero and therefore has a converging Taylor series.-->
Note that $\phi(z)$ is analytic at $\infty$ because it has a convergent Taylor expansion in inverse powers of $z$.  For $\vert z \vert > 1$,
$$
\phi(z) = -2\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2k+1)z^{2k+1} },
$$
hence $\phi(\infty) = 0$. We can also show that $\phi(z)$ is analytic at infinity by showing that  $\phi(z^{-1})$ is analytic at $z = 0$.
It follows from Cauchy's theorem (exterior) that
$$
\oint_{\gamma_\infty} {\phi(\zeta) \over \zeta -z} \D \zeta = 0
$$
as the integrand decays like $O(\zeta^{-2})$.

We are left with the integral on $\gamma_0$. We can think of it as a rectangular contour with contours
$[-1-\epsilon-\I \epsilon, -1 -\epsilon+\I \epsilon,1 +\epsilon+\I\epsilon,1+\epsilon-\I \epsilon]$.
Letting $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, on the contour above $\phi(z)$ tends to
$$
\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \phi(x + \I \epsilon) = \phi_+(x)
$$
and similar to the contour below. Since $\phi$ only has logarithmic singularities this limit
can be done safely. Thus we end up with the expression
$$
\phi(z) = {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{\gamma_0} {\phi(\zeta) \over \zeta -z} \D \zeta =
        {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{-1}^1 {\phi_+(x) - \phi_-(x) \over x - z} \D x = \int_{-1}^1 {1 \over x -z} \D x.
$$

__Example 2__

We repeat the above procedure with $\phi(z) = \sqrt{z-1} \sqrt{z+1}$. Again
this is analytic off $[-1,1]$ and we can express it as integrals over $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_\infty$.
Now it grows like $z$ at $\infty$,
$$
\phi(z) = z + O(z^{-1}),
$$
hence we have (as above)
$$
{1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{\gamma_\infty} {\phi(\zeta) \over \zeta - z} \D \zeta = z.
$$
The integral over the contour $\gamma_0$ can be collapsed. On the jump $-1 < x < 1$ we have
$$
\phi_+(x) = \sqrt{x-1}_+ \sqrt{x+1} = \I \sqrt{|x-1|} \sqrt{x+1} = \I \sqrt{1-x} \sqrt{x+1} = \I \sqrt{1-x^2}
$$
while $\phi_-(x) = - \phi_+(x) = - \I \sqrt{1-x^2}$.
We thus have
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(z) &= z + {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \oint_{\gamma_0} {\phi(\zeta) \over \zeta -z} \D \zeta =
        z + {1 \over 2 \pi \I} \int_{-1}^1 {\phi_+(x) - \phi_-(x) \over x - z} \D x \\
        &=
        z + {1 \over \pi} \int_{-1}^1 {\sqrt{1-x^2} \over x -z} \D x.
\end{align*}
$$
