# Lecture 23: Riemann-Hilbert problems


Let $\Gamma$ be the unit circle or real line (or more generally, a set of general contours, but we won't pursue that in this course).
Given functions $f$ and $g$ defined on $\Gamma$, a (scalar) Riemann–Hilbert problem consists of finding a function $\Psi(z)$ with left/right limits
$$\Psi_\pm(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \Psi(x \pm \I \epsilon),$$
satisfying the following conditions:

1. Analyticity: $\Psi(z)$ analytic in $\bar\C \backslash \Gamma$
2. Asymptotics: $\lim_{z \rightarrow \infty} \Psi(z) = C$
3. Regularity: $\Psi(z)$ has weaker than pole singularities everywhere
4. Jump: $\Psi_+(x) - g(x) \Psi_-(x) = f(x)$ for $x \in \Gamma$


Numerous applications! See [\[Trogdon & Olver 2015\]](http://bookstore.siam.org/ot146/). Here are some classical applications:

1. Ideal fluid flow
2. Solving integral equations via Weiner–Hopf factorization
3. Spectral analysis of Schrödinger operators

More recently, non-classical applications have arisen from integrable systems:

4. Solutions to Painlevé equations
5. Random matrix eigenvalue statistics
6. Asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials
7. Solving partial differential equations like the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation describing shallow water waves
$$
u_t + 6u u_x + u_{xxx} = 0
$$



We tackle the solution to an RH problem similar to a differential equation: first find the homogeneous solution
then use that to reduce inhomogeneous problems to something similar:
1. Homogeneous problems: $f = 0$
2. Inhomogeneous problems: $f \neq 0$




### Homogeneous Riemann–Hilbert problems on the real line

Let's assume $f$ is zero and $C = 1$, that is we wish to solve
$$
\Phi_+(\zeta) = g(\zeta) \Phi_-(\zeta) \qqand \Phi(\infty) = 1
$$

Formally, taking logs of both sides reduces this to a subtractive RH problem:
$$
\log \Phi_+(\zeta) - \log\Phi_-(\zeta) \questionequals \log g(\zeta)
$$
Assuming that $g(\zeta) \rightarrow 1$ as $\zeta \rightarrow \pm \infty$ at a sufficient rate, this motivates the guess
$$
\Phi(z) = \E^{\CC[\log g](z)}
$$

Assuming $\log g(x)$ is "nice", we have guaranteed that this is the unique solution:

**Theorem (Homogeneous solution to RH problem)** Suppose $\log g(\zeta)$ satisfies the conditions of Plemelj on $\Gamma$ (the real line or unit circle),
in particular, is continuously differentiable.
Then $\Phi(z) = \E^{\CC_\Gamma[\log g](z)}$ is the unique solution to the following RH problem:
1. Analyticity: $\Phi(z)$ is analytic off $\Gamma$
2. Asymptotics: $\lim_{z\rightarrow \infty}\Phi(z) = 1$
3. Regularity: $\Phi$ has weaker than pole singularities
2. Jump: $\Phi_+(\zeta) = g(\zeta) \Phi_-(\zeta)$ for $\zeta \in \Gamma$


**Proof** (1) follows from definition. (2) follows since $\CC[\log g](z) \rightarrow 0$. And (4) follows via:
$$
\Phi_+(\zeta) = \E^{\CC_+[\log g](\zeta)} = \E^{\CC_-[\log g](\zeta) + \log g(\zeta)} = \Phi_-(\zeta) g(\zeta)
$$
To see uniqueness, observe that we can take the reciprocal of $\Phi$, as it is an exponential of something finite.
Thus $\Phi(z)^{-1}$ is also analytic off $\R$. Therefore, if we have another solution $\tilde \Phi(z)$ we can consider $r(z) = \tilde\Phi(z) \Phi(z)^{-1}$ which satisfies:
$$
r_+(\zeta) = {\tilde\Phi_+(\zeta) \over \Phi_+(\zeta)} = {\tilde\Phi_-(\zeta) g(\zeta) \over \Phi_-(\zeta) g(\zeta)} = r_-(\zeta)
$$
Hence $r(z)$ is entire. since both terms tend to $1$, it must be $r(z) = 1$.


■

When is $\log g(\zeta)$ nice? For the real line it is necessary that $g(x) = 1 + O(x^{-1})$ at $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$. We also need to worry about the image:
for example, $g(\zeta) \neq 0$ is required to avoid a singularity.  We also need the winding number of the image of $g(\zeta)$ to be zero:
otherwise, $\log g(\zeta)$ will extend to another sheet and be discontinuous.   For example, if $g(z) = {z-\I \over z+\I}$ it satisfies the right asymptotics, but surrounds the origin:
```julia
using Plots, ComplexPhasePortrait
g = x -> (x-im)/(x+im)

xx = range(-10.,10.; length=1000)
plot(real.(g.(xx)), imag.(g.(xx)); label="image of (x-i)/(x+i)", ratio=1.0)
```
Therefore, $\log g(x)$ has a branch cut if we use the standard branch, which breaks the continuity requirement:
```julia
plot(xx, real.(log.(g.(xx))))
plot!(xx, imag.(log.(g.(xx))))
```
We could have analytically continued $\log g(z)$ using
$$
\log_1 z = \begin{cases} \log z & \Im z > 0 \\
                            \log_+ z & z < 0 \\
                            \log z + 2\pi \I & \Im z < 0
                            \end{cases}
$$
But then $\lim_{x\rightarrow + \infty} \log_1 g(x) = 2 \pi \I$:
```julia
log₁ = z -> imag(z) > 0 ? log(z) : log(z)+2π*im
plot(xx, real.(log₁.(g.(xx))))
plot!(xx, imag.(log₁.(g.(xx))))
```



**Example** Consider
$$
g(x) = {x^2+3 \over x^2+1} = 1 + O(x^{-1})
$$
Before we do anything _Verify that the winding number is zero_.


We provide two methods for calculating $\Phi$: one guesses the solution, the other uses the solution formula.


*Method 1 (Guess and check / kernel factorization)* If we can guess the solution, we can check it satisfies the right criteria.   Factoring $g$ we see immediately that
$$
g(x) = \left({x+\sqrt{3} \I \over x+\I}\right)\left({ x-\sqrt{3} \I \over  x-\I}\right)
$$
Note that the first term is analytic in  the upper half plane. The second term is analytic in the lower half plane _and_ we can take its reciprocal. Therefore we can guess the solution is
$$
\Phi(z)  = \begin{cases}
        {z+\sqrt 3\I \over z+\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
            {z-\I \over z-\sqrt 3\I} & \Im z < 0
           \end{cases}
$$
This satisfies the four conditions:
1. Analyticity: $\Phi$ is analytic off $\R$
2. Asymptotics: $\lim_{z\rightarrow \infty}\Phi(z) = 1$
3. Weaker than pole singularities
4. It has the right jump
$$
g(x) \Phi_-(x) =  {x^2+3 \over x^2+1} {x-\I \over x-\sqrt 3\I}  = {x+\sqrt 3 \I\over x+\I} = \Phi_+(x)
$$
This function is indeed analytic off the real line.



*Method 2 (evaluate explicit formula)* This is real valued and positive, hence the winding number of its image is zero.  We have
$$
\log g(x) = \log({x+\sqrt 3\I \over x+\I}{x-\sqrt 3\I \over x-\I})
$$
Because they are complex conjugates, we know $\log a \bar a = \log a + \log \bar a$ as $[1, \bar a, a]$ lies in the same half plane for $a = {s+\sqrt 3 \I \over s+ \I}$, therefore we can expand:
$$
\log g(x) = \log{x+\sqrt 3\I \over x+\I} + \log {x-\sqrt 3\I \over x-\I}
$$
Now we note that $\log{x+\sqrt 3\I \over x+\I}$ is analytic in the upper-half plane, therefore its Cauchy transform, by Plemelj, is
$$
\CC\br[\log{x+\sqrt 3\I \over x+\I}](z) = \begin{cases}
        \log{z+\sqrt 3\I \over z+\I} & \Im z < 0 \\
           0 & \Im z > 0
           \end{cases}
$$
Similarly,
$$
\CC\br[\log{x-\sqrt 3\I \over x-\I}](z) = \begin{cases}
        -\log{z-\sqrt 3\I \over z-\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
           0 & \Im z < 0
           \end{cases}
$$
We thus get:
$$
\Phi(z) = \E^{\CC\log g(z)} = \E^{\begin{cases}
        \log{z+\sqrt 3 \I \over z+\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
            -\log{z- \sqrt 3\I \over z-\I} & \Im z < 0
           \end{cases}} = \begin{cases}
        {z+ \sqrt 3 \I \over z+\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
            {z-\I \over z-\sqrt 3\I} & \Im z < 0
           \end{cases}
$$



### Inhomogeneous Riemann–Hilbert problem

Consider now the  Riemann–Hilbert problem with zero at infinity:
$$
\Psi_+(x) - g(x)\Psi_-(x) = f(x) \qqand \Psi(\infty) =0
$$
Consider writing $\Psi(z) =  \Phi(z) Y(z)$. Then we can reduce the Riemann–Hilbert problem to a subtractive problem:

$$
\Psi_+(x) - g(x)\Psi_-(x) = \Phi_+(x)(Y_+(x) - Y_-(x)) = f(x)\qqand Y(\infty) = 0
$$
Thus once we have $\Phi$, we can determine $Y$ as a Cauchy transform, and thence construct $\Psi$.

What if we don't have decay? Just add in a constant times $\Phi$:

**Corollary** Suppose $\log g$ satisfies the conditions of Plemelj's theorem. Then
$$
\Psi(z) = \Phi(z) \CC_\R\br[{f \over \Phi_+}](z) + D \Phi(z)
$$
is the unique solution to
$$
\Psi_+(\zeta) - g(\zeta)\Psi_-(\zeta) = f(\zeta) \qqand \Psi(\infty) =D
$$


*Example* Suppose $f(x) = {\I \over \I-x}$.

To decompose this as a sum of things analytic in half planes, we just use partial fraction expansion!
$$
\begin{align*}
{\I \over \I-x} {x + \I \over x+ \I \sqrt{3}} &= {\I \over \I-x}{2\I \over \I(1+ \sqrt{3})}  +{\I \over \I(1+\sqrt 3)} {\I(1-\sqrt 3) \over x+ \I \sqrt{3}}\\
&= \underbrace{{-2 \I \over x-\I}{1 \over 1+ \sqrt{3}}}_{-Y_-(x)}  + \underbrace{{\I \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over x+ \I \sqrt{3}}}_{Y_+(x)}
\end{align*}
$$
Thus we get
$$
Y(z) = \begin{cases}
{\I \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over z+ \I \sqrt{3}} & \Im z > 0 \\
{2 \I \over z-\I}{1 \over 1+ \sqrt{3}} & \Im z < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Let's double check:
We thus have the solution:
$$
\begin{align*}
\Psi(z)  &= \Phi(z) \CC_\R\br[{f \over \Phi_+}](z) = \begin{cases}
{\I \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over z+ \I \sqrt{3}} {z+\sqrt{3}\I \over z+\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
{2 \I \over z-\I}{1 \over 1+ \sqrt{3}} {z-\I \over z-\sqrt{3}\I} & \Im z < 0
\end{cases} \\
    &= \begin{cases}
{\I \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over z+\I} & \Im z > 0 \\
{2 \I  \over 1+ \sqrt{3}} {1 \over z-\sqrt{3}\I} & \Im z < 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
Let's verify it's the right thing:

1. It's analytic off $\R$
```julia
Ψ =  z -> imag(z) > 0 ? im*(1-sqrt(3))/(1+sqrt(3))/(z+im) :
                       2im/((z-sqrt(3)*im)*(1+sqrt(3)))

phaseplot(-3..3, -3..3, Ψ)
```
2\. It goes to zero at infinity
```julia
Ψ(300.0+300.0im)
```

3\. It satisfies the right jump:
$$
\begin{align*}
 \Psi_+(x) - g(x) \Psi_-(x) = {\I \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over x+\I}  - {x^2 + 3 \over x^2 + 1}
{2 \I  \over 1+ \sqrt{3}} {1 \over x-\sqrt{3}\I}  \\
 = {\I (x-\I) \over 1+\sqrt 3} {1-\sqrt 3 \over x^2+1}  - {x + \sqrt{3} \I \over x^2 + 1}
{2 \I  \over 1+ \sqrt{3}}  \\
= {1\over x^2 + 1}
{1 \over 1+ \sqrt{3}}  \left(\I(1-\sqrt 3) x+1-\sqrt{3}  - 2\I x + 2 \sqrt{3}    \right) \\
= {1\over x^2 + 1}
 \left(-\I x+1    \right) = {\I \over \I - x}
\end{align*}
$$
```julia
f = x -> im/(im-x)
g = x -> (x^2+3)/(x^2+1)
Ψ(0.1+eps()im) - Ψ(0.1-eps()im)*g(0.1) - f(0.1)
```
